## Flight-Bot

A facebook messenger bot that recommends the best flight based on a set of inputs. The recommendation is made from a set of training data that replicates actual flight schedules.

### Features

1. We have trained a single layer neural network with over 56,000 inputs of the training set and verified against the test set. The network predicts the number of seats remaining before the departure date with a confidence interval.

2. The algorithm suggests best nearby flights when a flight cannot be found on a particular day.

3. We have used Facebook recommended wit.ai bot engine for interactions with out bot.
